We describe methods used in a scalable deployed production system for extracting structured information from scientific documents into the literature graph (see Fig. 1 ). The literature graph is a directed property graph which summarizes key information in the literature and can be used to answer the queries mentioned earlier as well as more complex queries. For example, in order to compute the Erd\u0151s number of an author X, the graph can be queried to find the number of nodes on the shortest undirected path between author X and Paul Erd\u0151s such that all edges on the path are labeled \"authored\".",

These assumptions, while useful for developing and benchmarking new methods, are unrealistic for many domains and applications.

If one or more of the entity mentions in that paper is judged to be correct, the pair (paper ID, entity ID) counts as one correct instance. Otherwise, it counts as an incorrect instance. We report 'yield' in lieu of 'recall' due to the difficulty of doing a scalable comprehensive annotation. Table 2 shows the results based on 500 papers using v1.1.2 of our entity extraction and linking components. In both domains, the statistical approach gives the highest precision and the lowest yield. The hybrid approach consistently gives the highest yield, but sacrifices precision. The TagMe off-the-shelf library used for the CS domain gives surprisingly good results, with precision within 1 point from the statistical models. However, the MetaMap Lite off-the-shelf library we used for the biomedical domain suffered a huge loss in precision. Our error analysis showed that each of the approaches is able to predict entities not predicted by the other approaches so we decided to pool their outputs in our deployed system, which gives significantly higher yield than any individual approach while maintaining reasonably high precision.",

Moreover, different venues and sources use different conventions in reporting the author names, e.g., \"first initial, last name\" vs. \"last name, first name\". Inspired by Culotta et al. (2007) , we train a supervised binary classifier for merging pairs of author instances and use it to incrementally create author clusters. We only consider merging two author instances if they have the same last name and share the first initial. If the first name is spelled out (rather than abbreviated) in both author instances, we also require that the first name matches.",

For example, the concept of \"artificial neural networks\" is represented as entity ID D016571 in the MESH ontology, and represented as page ID '21523' in DBpedia. Ontology matching is the problem of identifying semantically-equivalent entities across KBs or ontologies. 9 Limited KB coverage. The convenience of grounding entities in a hand-curated KB comes at the cost of limited coverage. Introduction of new concepts and relations in the scientific literature occurs at a faster pace than KB curation, resulting in a large gap in KB coverage of scientific concepts. In order to close this gap, we need to develop models which can predict textual relations as well as detailed concept descriptions in scientific papers. For the same reasons, we also need to augment the relations imported from the KB with relations extracted from text. Our approach to address both entity and relation coverage is based on distant supervision (Mintz et al., 2009) . In short, we train two models for identifying entity definitions and relations expressed in natural language in scientific documents, and automatically generate labeled data for training these models using known definitions and relations in the KB.",

Non-textual components such as charts, diagrams and tables provide key information in many scientific documents, but the lack of large labeled datasets has impeded the development of data-driven methods for scientific figure extraction. In Siegel et al. (2018) , we induced high-quality training labels for the task of figure extraction in a large number of scientific documents, with no human intervention. To accomplish this we leveraged the auxiliary data provided in two large web collections of scientific documents (arXiv and PubMed) to locate figures and their associated captions in the rasterized PDF. We use the resulting dataset to train a deep neural network for end-to-end figure detection, yielding a model that can be more easily extended to new domains compared to previous work.",

The citation information also enables us to develop models for estimating the potential of a paper or an author. In Weihs and Etzioni (2017), we predict citationbased metrics such as an author's h-index and the citation rate of a paper in the future. Also related is the problem of predicting which papers should be cited in a given draft (Bhagavatula et al., 2018) , which can help improve the quality of a paper draft before it is submitted for peer review, or used to supplement the list of references after a paper is published.",
