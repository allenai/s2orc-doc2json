An understanding of the spatial dynamics of MGI and its controlling mechanisms is essential for an understanding of the role of MGI in energy and element cycling in the ocean. In the present study, we investigated the diversity and abundance of MGI in the East China Sea (ECS) by analysis of crenarchaeal 16S rRNA gene, the ammonia monooxygenase gene amoA, and the biotin carboxylase gene accA. Quantitative PCR analyses revealed that these genes were higher in abundance in the mesopelagic than in the euphotic zone. In addition, the crenarchaeal amoA gene was positively correlated with the copy number of the MGI 16S rRNA gene, suggesting that most of the MGI in the ECS are nitrifiers. Furthermore, the ratios of crenarchaeal accA to amoA or to MGI 16S rRNA genes increased from the euphotic to the mesopelagic zone, suggesting that the role of MGI in carbon cycling may change from the epipelagic to the mesopelagic zones. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoretic profiling of the 16S rRNA genes revealed depth partitioning in MGI community structures. Clone libraries of the crenarchaeal amoA and accA genes showed both \"shallow\" and \"deep\" groups, and their relative abundances varied in the water column. Ecotype simulation analysis revealed that MGI in the upper ocean could diverge into special ecotypes associated with depth to adapt to the light gradient across the water column.

In the central California Current, members of the \"deep group\" are strongly associated with deepwater transportation but are less active than their shallow-water-adapted counterparts, providing evidence that these two independent MGI groups indeed represent shallow-and deep-water-adapted \"ecotypes\" (48) . In the present work, we applied AdaptML modeling and found 10 ecotypes for the amoA and accA genes, while only two general lineages were demarcated based on common phylogenetic analyses (Fig. 6) . Definition of ecotypes with higher resolution would provide new insights into the evolutionary mechanisms of MGI speciation. More interestingly, although the accA gene abundance was extremely low in the epipelagic zone, 8 out of 10 ecotypes of both genes had similar depthrelated distribution patterns ( Fig. 6 and 7c and d) .

The qPCR assays indicated an amoA-to-16S rRNA gene ratio close to 2 at both stations, which is within the reference ranges reported previously for other regions of the Pacific Ocean (5, 8, 25, 48) . Numerous studies have demonstrated that crenarchaeal amoA genes are more abundant than those of AOB in various open oceans (5, 10, 48, 58) . In agreement with the results of those studies, our data suggest that ammonia-oxidizing archaea outcompete AOB in the open region of the study sites, which might be explained by the conspicuous adaptability of MGI to low concentrations of ammonia (38) . It was suggested previously that meso-and bathypelagic Crenarchaeota may lack the amoA gene, given the low ratios of amoA to 16S rRNA genes, and therefore are heterotrophic (1, 10) . This conclusion remains debatable due to the less comprehensive primers used in those studies (8, 33, 60) . In this study, besides the amoA genes, we quantified the abundance of accA genes, one of the key genes in the 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate pathway of mesophilic Crenarchaeota. Our results indicated that crenarchaeal accA genes were almost absent in the euphotic zone but were more abundant below the euphotic zone. The scarcity of crenarchaeal accA genes in the euphotic zone raised the possibility that epipelagic Crenarchaeota may rely on chemolithoheterotrophy and play a minor role in dissolved inorganic carbon fixation. However, a ratio of 1 amoA gene copy to 1 accA gene copy was found previously in the metagenomic data set recovered from surface water of the Sargasso Sea (21) . One possible explanation for this discrepancy is that some accA genes of epipelagic Crenarchaeota might have been missed in our qPCR assays, since the primers commonly used were designed based on only a few available sequences (25) . In contrast, in the upper mesopelagic zone, the ratios of crenarchaeal accA to MGI 16S rRNA genes or to crenarchaeal amoA genes were close to 1, which was in agreement with our previous investigation in the South China Sea (25) . This finding suggested that ammonia oxidization may be an important energy source for autotrophic CO 2 fixation by MGI in deep waters (1, 24) . Such chemoautotrophy can reduce the respiratory consumption of DOM and further provide fresh DOM for other microbial carbon demands. An earlier study revealed that CO 2 fixation by marine Crenarchaeota can meet the substantial carbon demand of the deep-sea microbial food web (46) . A portion of such fresh DOM could ultimately be transformed into recalcitrant DOM through the microbial carbon pump contributing ocean carbon sequestration (28) . The increasing ratio of crenarchaeal accA to amoA or to MGI 16S rRNA genes from the euphotic zone to the mesopelagic zone suggests that MGI could play a more important role in the dark ocean. The recognition of such a function of archaea at taxonomic-and functional-group levels would shed light on the mechanisms of carbon cycling in the ocean.
