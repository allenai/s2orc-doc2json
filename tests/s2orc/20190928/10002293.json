Microbial biofilms are considered the major cause for primary and secondary root canal infection and the success of endodontic treatment relies on the effective eradication of such biofilms (Nair, 2006) . Conventionally, this is accomplished by chemo-mechanical disruption with instruments and antimicrobial chemicals used topically inside root canals. However, current treatment strategies are insufficient to reduce microrganisms inside root canals below detection limits before permanent root filling. This is mandatory to achieve optimal healing conditions for the periapical tissues (Sj\u00f6gren et al., 1997) . Therefore, advanced disinfection approaches are required to effectively eradicate biofilms and increase the endodontic treatment success rate.It is widely accepted that the main reason for endodontic treatment failure is the insufficient root canal microrganisms eradication (Siqueira et al., 2000) . As residual species are not reachable to the host's immune system, propagation and re-colonization is highly possible, endorsing microbial spread inside root canal system, which leads to endodontic infections. In 1965, apical periodontitis was recognized as a microbial mediated infection, which was later reinforced by ultrastructural microscopic techniques, revealing bacteria organized as biofilms within the infected root canals (Nair, 1987) . Moreover, histopathological studies have also contributed to the concept that apical periodontitis is indeed a microbial biofilmmediated disease (Carr et al., 2009; Ricucci et al., 2009; Ricucci and Siqueira, 2010) .As described by Donlan and Costerton (2002) , a biofilm is a microbially derived sessile community characterized by cells that are irreversibly attached to a substratum or interface or to each other, are imbedded in a matrix of extracellular polymeric substances that they have produced, and exhibit an altered phenotype with respect to growth rate and gene transfer. In addition, it is accepted that microbial cells comprising the biofilm are more resistant than the planktonic counterparts (Donlan and Costerton, 2002) and multispecies or mixed biofilms are more resistant to drugs than monomicrobial biofilms (Costerton et al., 1999) . As such, polymicrobial biofilms diseases are associated with worse clinical outcomes than monomicrobial infections for decades (McKenzie, 2008) . Although the endodontic biofilm is constituted by multiple microrganisms (Tan et al., 2015) , most of in vitro studies have been made in monospecies biofilms of bacteria or combined with C. albicans (Sabino et al., 2015) .The problem of endodontic biofilms eradication from the infected root canal system remains as the primary focus in endodontic field. In recent years, photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been applied with success in several types of cancers (Ochsner, 1997; Gomes et al., 2015) , age-related macular degeneration (Kawczyk-Krupka et al., 2015) and also in the photoinactivation of several microrganisms (Almeida et al., 2014) , called antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT). In the endodontic field, aPDT has emerged as an optional extra to classical irrigation solutions in root canal asepsis (Bonsor et al., 2006a,b) such as sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX) and ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA). The NaOCl solution is the most widely used in endodontic treatment (Siqueira et al., 2007; Mohammadi, 2008; Vaziri et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2015) albeit with some degree of toxicity. To avoid this toxicity, other root canal asepsis approaches with lower or insignificant toxicity should be implemented. Therefore, aPDT has emerged with promising experimental results, anticipating a possible new era in endodontic disinfection (Siddiqui et al., 2013; Chrepa et al., 2014) .Photodynamic therapy involves the combination of a nontoxic photosensitizer (PS) with a harmless visible light source in the presence of oxygen. After being excited by light, the PS releases its energy or electrons to molecular oxygen producing highly reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 ), which induce microrganism's injury and death, ideally with no host cell damage. Also, it has been indicated as bearing a strong potential in the fight against antimicrobial resistance (Hamblin and Hasan, 2004; Tavares et al., 2010; Costa et al., 2011) . aPDT has also been studied as an auspicious approach to eradicate oral pathogenic microrganisms that cause, not only endodontic diseases, but also periodontitis, peri-implantitis, caries lesions and mucositis (Diogo et al., 2015) .In this study, we analyzed the aPDT efficacy against monospecies and mixed biofilms of E. faecalis and C. albicans using the following PSs: toluidine blue (TBO), rose bengal (RB), a synthetic porphyrin 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(1-methylpyridinium-4-yl)porphyrin (TMPyP) and Zn(II)chlorin e 6 methyl ester (Zn(II)e 6 Me) obtained from chlorophyll a (Figure 1) . The antimicrobial results obtained by aPDT approach were compared with the ones achieved with three endodontic classical irrigants 3% NaOCl, 2% CHX, and 17% EDTA toward in vitro biofilms.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 131, "end": 154, "text": "(Siqueira et al., 2000;", "latex": null, "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 155, "end": 166, "text": "Nair, 2006)", "latex": null, "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 359, "end": 371, "text": "(Nair, 2006)", "latex": null, "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 757, "end": 779, "text": "(Sj\u00f6gren et al., 1997)", "latex": null, "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 1057, "end": 1080, "text": "(Siqueira et al., 2000)", "latex": null, "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 1516, "end": 1528, "text": "(Nair, 1987)", "latex": null, "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1676, "end": 1695, "text": "(Carr et al., 2009;", "latex": null, "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1696, "end": 1717, "text": "Ricucci et al., 2009;", "latex": null, "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 1718, "end": 1745, "text": "Ricucci and Siqueira, 2010)", "latex": null, "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1763, "end": 1790, "text": "Donlan and Costerton (2002)", "latex": null, "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2239, "end": 2267, "text": "(Donlan and Costerton, 2002)", "latex": null, "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2359, "end": 2383, "text": "(Costerton et al., 1999)", "latex": null, "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2513, "end": 2529, "text": "(McKenzie, 2008)", "latex": null, "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 2605, "end": 2623, "text": "(Tan et al., 2015)", "latex": null, "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 2731, "end": 2752, "text": "(Sabino et al., 2015)", "latex": null, "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 2989, "end": 3004, "text": "(Ochsner, 1997;", "latex": null, "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 3005, "end": 3024, "text": "Gomes et al., 2015)", "latex": null, "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 3060, "end": 3089, "text": "(Kawczyk-Krupka et al., 2015)", "latex": null, "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 3149, "end": 3171, "text": "(Almeida et al., 2014)", "latex": null, "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 3343, "end": 3358, "text": "(Bonsor et al.,", "latex": null, "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3547, "end": 3570, "text": "(Siqueira et al., 2007;", "latex": null, "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 3571, "end": 3587, "text": "Mohammadi, 2008;", "latex": null, "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 3588, "end": 3608, "text": "Vaziri et al., 2012;", "latex": null, "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 3609, "end": 3627, "text": "Wang et al., 2015)", "latex": null, "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 3909, "end": 3932, "text": "(Siddiqui et al., 2013;", "latex": null, "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 3933, "end": 3953, "text": "Chrepa et al., 2014)", "latex": null, "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 4455, "end": 4480, "text": "(Hamblin and Hasan, 2004;", "latex": null, "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 4481, "end": 4502, "text": "Tavares et al., 2010;", "latex": null, "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 4503, "end": 4522, "text": "Costa et al., 2011)", "latex": null, "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 4734, "end": 4754, "text": "(Diogo et al., 2015)", "latex": null, "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 5098, "end": 5108, "text": "(Figure 1)", "latex": null, "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "eq_spans": [], "section": null}, {"text": "The strain of C. albicans (YP0037) used in this study was obtained from the Pathogenic Yeast Collection of FMUC, University of Coimbra.

In this mixed community of E. faecalis and C. albicans, Zn(II)e 6 Me demonstrated to be the most efficient PS removing 58.98% of biofilm biomass (P < 0.001). When compared to classical irrigants, Zn(II)e 6 Me was not as effective as NaOCl, the treatment that causes the higher damage, regardless of the type of biofilm (Figure 3 ; right panels). In fact, Zn(II)e 6 Me (with an irradiation period of 90 s) was more effective in removing E. faecalis biofilm than EDTA or CHX (Table 2 and Figure 3 ; upper panel). Zn(II)e 6 Me reveal the same effect of CHX or EDTA treatment toward C. albicans biofilms (90 s) and toward mixed biofilms, either with 60 s or with 90 s of irradiation (Table 2 and Figure 3 ; middle and lower panels).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 777, "end": 786, "text": "(Table 1)", "latex": null, "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 1480, "end": 1488, "text": "Figure 3", "latex": null, "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1752, "end": 1761, "text": "(Figure 3", "latex": null, "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2958, "end": 2967, "text": "(Figure 3", "latex": null, "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3289, "end": 3312, "text": "(Figure 3; lower panel)", "latex": null, "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3634, "end": 3643, "text": "(Figure 3", "latex": null, "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3801, "end": 3809, "text": "Figure 3", "latex": null, "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4007, "end": 4015, "text": "Figure 3", "latex": null, "ref_id": null}], "eq_spans": [], "section": null}, {"text": "The study of biofilms morphology was performed after 48 h of biofilm maturation, because 48 h-and 72 h-biofilms had similar morphologies.

Otherwise, NaOCl eliminated all the cells adhered to the glass slide, either in E. faecalis or C. albicans biofilms (Figures 4C,F) .Using light microscopy, it was observed that while NaOCl lead to an almost complete loss of living cells (Figure 5C ), aPDT with Zn(II)e 6 Me resulted in a mixed biofilm with less E. faecalis cells and less C. albicans hypha, with a predominance of pear shaped cells (Figure 5B ), when compared with the morphology of the untreated mixed biofilm (Figure 5A ).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 394, "end": 407, "text": "(Figures 4A,B", "latex": null, "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 476, "end": 490, "text": "(Figures 4D,E)", "latex": null, "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 609, "end": 623, "text": "(Figures 4C,F)", "latex": null, "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 730, "end": 740, "text": "(Figure 5C", "latex": null, "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 892, "end": 902, "text": "(Figure 5B", "latex": null, "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 971, "end": 981, "text": "(Figure 5A", "latex": null, "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}], "eq_spans": [], "section": null}, {"text": "The different morphological aspects observed in the fluorescence confocal microscopy lead us to study the ultrastructural changes using TEM.

The complexity of the cellular ultrastructure of C. albicans, a eukaryote, allowed the observation of induced modifications. Most of the yeast cells showed an atypical irregular cell wall thickness and the cytoplasmic membrane integrity was lost, with cell membrane invaginations ( Figure 6G ), caused by 90 s of Zn(II)e 6 Me-aPDT treatment.The cell membrane was damaged and the cell wall surface was rougher ( Figure 6H ) than in control cells ( Figure 6B ). Abnormal intracellular membrane arrangements probably corresponding to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) whorls ( Figure 6I) were also observed. Some C. albicans cells exhibited big vacuoles with electrodense materials (Figure 6J) . A general view of the mixed biofilms showed E. faecalis cell wall structures devoid of the intracellular content and irregular C. albicans cell walls ( Figure 6K) . In fact, in mixed biofilms microbial cells ultrastructural modifications were similar to those observed in monospecies biofilms, including invaginations of the cell membrane found in C. albicans cells (Figure 6L) . Additionally, in mixed biofilms, C. albicans cells showed persistent extracellular vesicles, at the surface of the cell wall, with different sizes and shapes ( Figure 6M) . In Figure 6N it is also possible to observe several ultrastructural features of mixed biofilms treated with Zn(II)e 6 Me by PDT: in the extracellular matrix, besides the spread of electrodense materials typical of a biofilm matrix, fragments of membranes or of fibrous materials were also observed, which were not observed in E. faecalis-C. albicans mixed biofilms untreated ( Figure 6C) ; also, the cytoplasm of E. faecalis showed electrodense agglomerates and some fungal cells showed a twisted irregular shape.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 943, "end": 958, "text": "Figures 6A,D-F)", "latex": null, "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}, {"start": 1243, "end": 1252, "text": "Figure 6G", "latex": null, "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}, {"start": 1372, "end": 1381, "text": "Figure 6H", "latex": null, "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}, {"start": 1408, "end": 1417, "text": "Figure 6B", "latex": null, "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}, {"start": 1528, "end": 1538, "text": "Figure 6I)", "latex": null, "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}, {"start": 1633, "end": 1644, "text": "(Figure 6J)", "latex": null, "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}, {"start": 1799, "end": 1809, "text": "Figure 6K)", "latex": null, "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}, {"start": 2013, "end": 2024, "text": "(Figure 6L)", "latex": null, "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}, {"start": 2187, "end": 2197, "text": "Figure 6M)", "latex": null, "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}, {"start": 2203, "end": 2212, "text": "Figure 6N", "latex": null, "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}, {"start": 2577, "end": 2587, "text": "Figure 6C)", "latex": null, "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}], "eq_spans": [], "section": null}, {"text": "The aim of this work was to compare the efficacy of Zn(II)e 6 Me to disturb in vitro models of endodontic biofilms comparatively with three other PSs, TBO, RB, and TMPyP, and also with endodontic classical irrigants. For this, monospecies biofilms of E. faecalis and of C. albicans were used, together with a mixed biofilm model with both microrganisms. The main conclusion is that Zn(II)e 6 Me had a better antimicrobial efficacy than the clinically used PSs, TBO, and RB. Although the efficacy of Zn(II)e 6 Me and TMPyP is similar, one of the main advantage of using Zn(II)e 6 Me is its availability from natural sources, associated to a lower toxicity in the total absence of light. It also presented the same antimicrobial potential than the clinically used classical irrigants, CHX and EDTA. It is worth mentioning that TBO (Seal et al., 2002; Bergmans et al., 2008; Rios et al., 2011) is available in the market under the name of Fotosan R agent (Gambarini et al., 2011; Rios et al., 2011) and RB has been widely studied (Shrestha et al., 2012 (Shrestha et al., , 2014 Persadmehr et al., 2014) . As expected, 3% NaOCl had the best final outcomes. In fact, NaOCl at different concentrations, is considered an excellent irrigant solution in endodontics (Jeansonne and White, 1994; Siqueira et al., 2007; Mohammadi, 2008) , nevertheless it also displays high toxicity levels toward the host tissues (Estrela et al., 2002; \u00d6n\u00e7a\u01e7 et al., 2003; Trevino et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2015) .The antimicrobial effect of aPDT is dependent both on the cellular localization of the PS, which may be determined by its physicochemical properties (Castano et al., 2004) and on the diffusion of singlet oxygen that should be sufficient to inactivate microrganisms structures and biomolecules. There have been several reports on the use of aPDT to kill both yeast and bacteria, however, fungi are much more complex targets than bacteria. Nevertheless, similarities with mammalian cells should be considered and this may indicate the use of cationic PSs, rather than their anionic counterparts, since the latter exhibit facile uptake by mammalian cells (Bonnett, 1995) . The biochemical and functional effects of photosensitization include peroxidation of lipids, resulting in cell membranes disruption, lysosomes and mitochondria lysis and consequently autophagy (Schuck et al., 2014) . The phenothiaziniums, such as TBO and MB, are known to target plasma membrane of yeast and bacteria (de Melo et al., 2013; Baltazar et al., 2015) ; TBO was described as increasing cell wall permeability (Wainwright et al., 1997) , whereas MB produces bacterial DNA damage (Menezes et al., 1990) .The use of cholorophylls in endodontic root canal treatment was previously described (Mohammadi et al., 2013) . There are evidencies showing that clorophyll present in green tea can be used in endodontic root canal treatment due to its antibacterial effects (Horiba et al., 1991) . In this work, we describe Zn(II)e 6 Me, obtained from the natural chlorophyll a, as a encouraging PS candidate displaying consistent antimicrobial outcomes. The ultrastructural study of microbial cells upon aPDT demonstrated that using Zn(II)e 6 Me as PS, results in the irreversible damage of E. faecalis cells (mono and dualspecies biofilms), displaying 'cell ghosts' , empty of its cellular content but with almost intact cell walls. The presence of these inactive \"ghost\" cells was corroborated by the biomass loss assessed by SR assay. Before, it was described that E. faecalis elimination with aPDT resulted in bleb formations suggestive of damage of membrane components (L\u00f3pez-Jim\u00e9nez et al., 2015) , shrunken, bacterial cell diameter reduction, rough and fractured appearance of the bacterial cells (Cheng et al., 2012) . It was also described the presence of bacterial cell membrane shriveling and alterations including loss of cocci or bacilli shape, grooves on the cell surface and draining of the intracellular components (Garcez et al., 2013) . According to our observations, E. faecalis cell wall destruction was sporadic and not a massive one, which appear to indicate that the induced damage was directed to proteins and/or lipids of the cytoplasmic membrane, resulting in the leakage of cellular contents, as described by others (Girotti, 2001) . It is also known that the extension of biochemical changes induced by aPDT is dependent on the PS nature and on the irradiation period (Dai et al., 2009) . In this study the aPDT proceeded during a short period (60 or 90 s), which can justify the punctual cell wall destruction in E. faecalis.In C. albicans cells in monospecies biofilms and in C. albicans cells in mixed biofilms, it was noticed several changes in the cellular organization, with a cytoplasmic membrane disruption, vacuoles morphology and organelles damage including signals of autophagy (e.g., ER whorls, and organelles inclusion in vacuoles) as described by others (Prates et al., 2011; Schuck et al., 2014) . The intracellular damage induced by aPDT with Zn(II)e 6 Me is probably dependent on the entry of this PS, since this feature is crucial for aPDT efficacy and outcomes (Hamblin and Hasan, 2004; Baltazar et al., 2015) . This lead us to speculate that the preincubation period of biofilms with PSs during 15 min in total absence of light, before the short irradiation period (60 and 90 s) most certainly contributed for the interaction between the PS and the cell. This would lead to intracellular PS distribution (due to its hydrophobic nature), impacting in the genesis of the intracellular damage observed. The questions raised by these observations highlight the importance of future further studies to unravel the intracellular distribution of Zn(II)e 6 Me. The Zn(II)e 6 Me antimicrobial potential, that we showed by quantification of biofilm biomass loss and by a microscopic study of the biofilm morphology and of the cellular ultrastructure, leads to the importance of defining the mechanism by which this modified chlorophyll affects the endodontic biofilms.Based on this, further research will be mandatory to improve the antimicrobial efficacy of aPDT in the root canal system, such as the ones recently published (Tennert et al., 2015; Cieplik et al., 2016) using human tooth models, ultimately leading to an optimization of light delivery and new PS formulations.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 829, "end": 848, "text": "(Seal et al., 2002;", "latex": null, "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 849, "end": 871, "text": "Bergmans et al., 2008;", "latex": null, "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 872, "end": 890, "text": "Rios et al., 2011)", "latex": null, "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 952, "end": 976, "text": "(Gambarini et al., 2011;", "latex": null, "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 977, "end": 995, "text": "Rios et al., 2011)", "latex": null, "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 1027, "end": 1049, "text": "(Shrestha et al., 2012", "latex": null, "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 1050, "end": 1074, "text": "(Shrestha et al., , 2014", "latex": null, "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 1075, "end": 1099, "text": "Persadmehr et al., 2014)", "latex": null, "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 1257, "end": 1284, "text": "(Jeansonne and White, 1994;", "latex": null, "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1285, "end": 1307, "text": "Siqueira et al., 2007;", "latex": null, "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 1308, "end": 1324, "text": "Mohammadi, 2008)", "latex": null, "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1425, "end": 1444, "text": "\u00d6n\u00e7a\u01e7 et al., 2003;", "latex": null, "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 1445, "end": 1466, "text": "Trevino et al., 2011;", "latex": null, "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 1467, "end": 1485, "text": "Wang et al., 2015)", "latex": null, "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 1636, "end": 1658, "text": "(Castano et al., 2004)", "latex": null, "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2139, "end": 2154, "text": "(Bonnett, 1995)", "latex": null, "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 2350, "end": 2371, "text": "(Schuck et al., 2014)", "latex": null, "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 2474, "end": 2496, "text": "(de Melo et al., 2013;", "latex": null, "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2497, "end": 2519, "text": "Baltazar et al., 2015)", "latex": null, "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 2577, "end": 2602, "text": "(Wainwright et al., 1997)", "latex": null, "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 2646, "end": 2668, "text": "(Menezes et al., 1990)", "latex": null, "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 2755, "end": 2779, "text": "(Mohammadi et al., 2013)", "latex": null, "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 2928, "end": 2949, "text": "(Horiba et al., 1991)", "latex": null, "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 3629, "end": 3657, "text": "(L\u00f3pez-Jim\u00e9nez et al., 2015)", "latex": null, "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 3759, "end": 3779, "text": "(Cheng et al., 2012)", "latex": null, "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 3986, "end": 4007, "text": "(Garcez et al., 2013)", "latex": null, "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 4298, "end": 4313, "text": "(Girotti, 2001)", "latex": null, "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 4451, "end": 4469, "text": "(Dai et al., 2009)", "latex": null, "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 4951, "end": 4972, "text": "(Prates et al., 2011;", "latex": null, "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 4973, "end": 4993, "text": "Schuck et al., 2014)", "latex": null, "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 5163, "end": 5188, "text": "(Hamblin and Hasan, 2004;", "latex": null, "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 5189, "end": 5211, "text": "Baltazar et al., 2015)", "latex": null, "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 6219, "end": 6241, "text": "(Tennert et al., 2015;", "latex": null, "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 6242, "end": 6263, "text": "Cieplik et al., 2016)", "latex": null, "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}], "ref_spans": [], "eq_spans": [], "section": null}, {"text": "PD, IM, JS, FC, and TG were responsible for the conception and design of the study, and for the analysis and interpretation of data; PD, CF, FC, and MM did most of the lab work and analysis of data; PD and TG did most of the manuscript writings; MF, MN, MU, and KdO extracted, modified and analyzed two of the PDT compounds; all the authors contributed equally to the revision of the manuscript and approved the final version to be submitted.
