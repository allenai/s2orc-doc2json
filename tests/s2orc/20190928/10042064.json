As a result, increasing attention has been devoted in policy debates to the welfare consequences of FDI for the host country and to the factors affecting multinationals' choice of location. A consensus seems to have emerged around some commonly accepted views which form a \"conventional wisdom\" on FDI. Three of these conventional views are: (1) Inward FDI is welfare improving for a host country, regardless of the type of labour market institutions; (2) Multinational enterprises (MNEs) prefer decentralised firm level wage bargaining processes to centralised ones; (3) Governments should subsidise inward FDI, in particular in the presence of unionised labour markets.The first of these conventional wisdoms concerns the welfare effects of FDI for the host country. Although different interest groups within an economy may hold conflicting views as to the desirability of inward FDI, it is probably appropriate to state that on balance governments see it as welfare improving 1 . Thus, increasingly, \"international competitiveness\" is not only meant to reflect the ability of a country to compete on international goods markets, but also its attractiveness to foreign MNEs.The second conventional wisdom relates to the determinants of multinationals' choice of location, amongst which labour market characteristics and institutions are considered major factors. According to the emerging consensus, MNEs prefer flexible nonunionised labour markets and, when unionisation is in place, decentralised firm level wage bargaining processes over centralised ones. Despite ample empirical evidence (UN Investment Report, 1997) suggesting that labour costs are just one of the many considerations behind MNEs' location decisions, this view rests on the assumption that they are crucial in determining countries' ability to compete for FDI: by increasing labour costs, unionisation is detrimental to a country's attractiveness to MNEs. This type of argument has often been used in relatively highly unionised industrialised countries to endorse legislation aimed at limiting unions' power and deregulating the bargaining 1 Typical benefits associated with inward FDI are increased employment, technological externalities, emergence of new and/or more dynamic sectors, procompetitive effects on industry structure. Amongst its costs is the excessive competitive pressure on home firms which may force them out of business rather than stimulate their efficiency. Furthermore, as Zhao (1995) and Lahiri and Ono (1997) point out, the possible emergence of cross-hauling in FDI, may induce an \"export of jobs\" thus outweighing the creation of new jobs by the inward FDI.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1702, "end": 1715, "text": "Report, 1997)", "latex": null, "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2564, "end": 2575, "text": "Zhao (1995)", "latex": null, "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2580, "end": 2601, "text": "Lahiri and Ono (1997)", "latex": null, "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}], "ref_spans": [], "eq_spans": [], "section": null}, {"text": "process.The third conventional wisdom is almost a corollary of the other two. The desirability of inward FDI suggests the need for subsidising it, in particular when unionised labour markets are likely to make a host country less attractive to foreign MNEs. It is in fact common practice for national governments to subsidise and to compete for inward FDI 2 .This paper attempts to evaluate the conventional wisdom outlined above in the context of unionised labour markets.The interaction between labour market unionisation and FDI has received surprisingly little attention in the theoretical literature where the two have mostly been studied separately. Imperfect competition and positive profits create incentives for strategic trade policy to attract and extract rents from MNEs, as for instance in Brander and Spencer (1987) , Bond and Samuelson (1989) and Janeba (1996) . The effects of trade on labour markets have been typically studied within the theory of distortions (e.g. Bhagwati and Srinivasan, 1983) or the political economy framework (Dinoupoulos, 1983) .More recently, Brecher and Van Long (1989) analyse the impact of protection on employment and welfare in an open economy with a central union. Brander and Spencer (1988) and Santoni (1996) analyse the effect of unionisation and trade policies in a NashCournot duopoly where a unionised home firm competes against a foreign firm. Huzinga (1993) and Naylor (1998) examine the effects of market integration within a unionised sector. Very little work has been done on the relationship between labour market unionisation and FDI. Notable exception is Zhao (1995 Zhao ( , 1998 where cross-hauling FDI is generated between two countries with imperfectly competitive product markets and unionised labour markets. Naylor and Santoni (1998) analyse the effects of union power and degree of substitutability between products on FDI.Within the unionisation-FDI literature, our paper is the first of which we are aware to: (1) examine the effects of different degrees of union centralisation on FDI and welfare, (2) study the role of different modes of product market interaction between MNEs and domestic firms, (3) analyse the optimal policy towards FDI when unions extract rents from wage it faces 3 . The focus of our analysis may be especially relevant to Europe where labour markets are generally highly unionised but where the degree of centralisation varies greatly across countries (Freeman and Katz, 1995) and where countries are characterised by different patterns of inwards FDI (Barrel and Pain, 1997) .We consider two alternative wage setting regimes. The first is decentralised, with trade unions bargaining individually with each firm. The second is a centralised regime in which one single wage is set for an industry or group of industries. In the latter case, the wage setting process represents a link between the MNE and the domestic firms, even when direct product market competition between them is absent.Our analysis shows that the results crucially depend on the nature of product market interaction between the MNE and host country's firms. We consider two situations. In the first there is no product market interaction, and the MNE will not compete with home firms either in the domestic or in any other market. This allows us to isolate the effects of wage determination on the host country's welfare and on the MNE's decisions. We subsequently allow for product market interaction, which could occur in either the domestic or in an export market. This is not an academic distinction but one which may be seen as reflecting the motives behind a MNE's decision to locate in a host country. When the latter is seen by the MNE as an export base, the absence of direct competition with domestic firms is a plausible assumption. This is more likely the smaller is the economic size of the host country relative to the MNE's export market. A typical example of this is Ireland: its high share of inward FDI, which could not be ascribed to the extent of its domestic market, has mainly occurred in sectors which did not have a significant presence of indigenous firms. If, however, the MNE is attracted by domestic sales, it is likely (particularly in relatively large industrialised countries) that it will face competition from the host country's firms .The model is developed in Section 2. Section 3 and 4 look at the alternative product market interaction cases, carry out welfare comparisons across different regimes and discuss the implications for policy towards FDI. Section 5 endogenises the level of capital investment of the MNE and analyses the government's optimal policy. Section 6 concludes the paper.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 800, "end": 829, "text": "in Brander and Spencer (1987)", "latex": null, "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 832, "end": 857, "text": "Bond and Samuelson (1989)", "latex": null, "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 862, "end": 875, "text": "Janeba (1996)", "latex": null, "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 984, "end": 1014, "text": "Bhagwati and Srinivasan, 1983)", "latex": null, "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1050, "end": 1069, "text": "(Dinoupoulos, 1983)", "latex": null, "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1086, "end": 1113, "text": "Brecher and Van Long (1989)", "latex": null, "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1214, "end": 1240, "text": "Brander and Spencer (1988)", "latex": null, "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1245, "end": 1259, "text": "Santoni (1996)", "latex": null, "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1408, "end": 1414, "text": "(1993)", "latex": null, "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1419, "end": 1432, "text": "Naylor (1998)", "latex": null, "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1618, "end": 1628, "text": "Zhao (1995", "latex": null, "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1629, "end": 1642, "text": "Zhao ( , 1998", "latex": null, "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1777, "end": 1802, "text": "Naylor and Santoni (1998)", "latex": null, "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 2450, "end": 2474, "text": "(Freeman and Katz, 1995)", "latex": null, "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2550, "end": 2573, "text": "(Barrel and Pain, 1997)", "latex": null, "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}], "ref_spans": [], "eq_spans": [], "section": null}, {"text": "Consider a model with a multinational which may set up in a host country where N symmetric domestic firms are already located. All firms (including the MNE) are unionised.We model the interaction between agents as a three-stage game. In stage one, the MNE decides whether to locate in the host country. In stage two, unions choose the wage at which labour will be supplied to firms 4 . We consider two alternative wage setting regimes. The first is decentralised with the unions bargaining individually with each firm. In the second, the wage bargaining is concluded centrally and one wage is set for all firms in the country. In stage three, firms choose their output levels. Two types of product market competition are analysed: (1) the home firms and the MNE do not compete in the product market and the MNE exports all of its output; (2) domestic firms and the MNE all compete in the same market which may or may not be the home market itself.In the absence of direct product market interaction between the MNE and domestic firms, the latter may sell in the home market or be exporters. If the MNE locates it will hire labour at a wage * w , set in stage two by the unions.For a firm to prosper in a foreign environment, it will generally possess some firm specific advantages (Dunning, 1988) . We assume this firm-specific advantage to consist of 6 a higher labour productivity, resulting from technical superiority and/or higher capital intensity 6 .

In this section we endogenise the MNE's optimal investment decision and we analyse how it is affected by the different bargaining regimes.

As far as we know this is the first time that this strategic incentive to under-engage in FDI has been isolated: it is not just high wages that deter FDI, or where its profit constraint is not binding. . However, as was previously discussed, even in the linear case this condition may not hold: a higher K will increase the potential for rent extraction, but the resulting higher wage will damage employment opportunities not only in the MNE but also in the less efficient domestic sector. Therefore circumstances may arise where unions choose to reduce the wage to increase employment. Hence, under centralised bargaining, even in the linear case, the MNE may over or underinvest in capital, depending on the effect of its investment on the wage.In the first stage of the game, the government chooses the capital subsidy to maximise domestic welfare. The total welfare function now includes the total subsidy bill and is given by:K ) U ( U CS W n i i i * \u03c3 \u03c0 \u2212 + + + = \u2211 (19)With decentralised unions, we obtain the following optimal subsidy:K ) K , w ( L ) w w ( d dK K m * m d NI \u2202 \u2202 \u03c3 \u03c3 \u2212 + \u2212 =(20)where the subscript \"NI\" and the superscript \"d\" indicate \"no market interaction\" and \"decentralised wage setting\" respectively. The two terms on the right-hand-side of (20) represent the two rent extraction motives for the government subsidy/tax policy. The first is a direct effect through taxing the multinational firm's capital and is negative. The second is indirect and stems from the unionisation of the labour market (this term clearly equalsK ) w , K ( U m * \u2202 \u2202). This term occurs because the government wishes to raise employment in the multinational sector when there are rents to be extracted there. If this is negative, so that an increase in K reduces employment, this effect works towards a tax. It is straightforward to show that in the linear case this must hold.In the centralised case, the optimal subsidy will be given by:dK dw 1 dw dq ) q ( p N M Nq K ) K , w ( L ) w w ( d dK K c c c * c c NI \uf8fe \uf8fd \uf8fc \uf8f3 \uf8f2 \uf8f1 + \u2032 \u2212 \u2212 + \u2212 = \u2202 \u2202 \u03c3 \u03c3 (21)Clearly the first two terms on the right-hand-side of (21) have the same interpretation as in equation (20) Equations (20) and (21) \u03c3 .

As in the no-marketinteraction case, the first term of (23) captures the incentive to tax K and reflects the direct cost to the government of subsidisation. This term, therefore, works against a subsidy. The second term, within chain brackets, reflects the impact of a capital increase on the MNE's level of employment. It consists of a direct effect at constant wages (present even without market interaction) and an indirect effect which works through the rivals' wages; the former may be positive or negative, depending on which of the productivity or output effects of a capital increase dominates; the indirect effect will typically be negative, thus working towards a tax. The third term captures the effects of a policy induced change in K on the domestic sector's employment and union rents. This can be written as: This overall effect is also likely to be negative. The fourth term in (23) is new and captures changes in domestic firms' profitability resulting from changes in K. This term is likely to be negative and therefore works towards a tax. If the multinational sells its product on the domestic market, the last term of equation (23) will exist and reflect the effect of the capital subsidy on consumers' surplus.

The third can now be written as: Clearly, when the constraint is binding, the capital subsidy plays a role analogous to the location subsidy examined in Section 5. The government will want to encourage the MNE's only if its \"welfare value\" is positive. As we have seen in the previous section, circumstances may exist in which this welfare value may not be positive.\uf8fa \uf8fb \uf8f9 \uf8ef \uf8f0 \uf8ee \u2212 \u2202 \u2202 \u2212 = \u2212 dK dw Q K Q ) w w ( dK dQ ) w w (In this section we have endogenized the MNE's capital choice and explored the optimal policy towards foreign capital investment. The strategic effect of the MNE's investment on the wage is crucial in determining both the MNE's investment decision and the government's optimal policy. In the decentralised wage-setting case, a higher level of K raises the wage faced by the MNE ( w * ). This is also the normal case under centralised wage setting without market interaction. However under centralised wage setting and market interaction this is often reversed.It follows from the above that when wages are set at the firm level, the MNE will strategically underinvest in capital in order to keep the wage down. This will be reversed in those centralised wage setting situations in which the wage is negatively related to the level of capital invested.With respect to the optimal policy, the no-market interaction subsidy under wage centralisation contains a term that is not present when wages are set at the firm level. This extra term, due to the negative distortionary effects of a higher centralised wage, works towards a tax when the wage increases in capital. Things are less clear in the market interaction case as the centralised wage may fall in the level of K. In general however, these results confirm that the host country's government may not find it optimal to encourage a higher level of FDI via capital subsidisation.Thus, in the paper we have looked at the two dimension of FDI: location and the amount of capital committed. We have found that in both cases the government will often wish to discourage FDI, in particular in the presence of negative externalities generated by the MNE towards domestic firms through either the goods or the unionised labour market.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "eq_spans": [], "section": null}, {"text": "This paper focuses on the nature of product market interaction between a MNE and a host country's firms in examining the effects of different degrees of wage setting centralisation on (1) the incentive of a MNE to locate in the host country, (2) the optimal level of investment it decides to commit to its foreign operation, and (3) the host country's welfare.Our results suggest that there may be circumstances in which it will not be desirable for a government to encourage inward FDI. We find that negative welfare effects of FDI occur when there is direct product market competition between the MNE and the host country's firms. In this case the foreign MNE will effectively capture market shares from indigenous firms thus reducing their profits. This effect is shown to be particularly strong in the presence of centralised wage setting processes. Hence, we highlight a channel through which inward FDI can have adverse effects on the host country's welfare. Clearly, in real world situations the net change in welfare would depend on many other factors (e.g.technical spill-overs from foreign firms). However, we believe that our findings, which cast at least some doubts on the general validity of the commonly held view that FDI is always welfare improving, are intuitive and are consistent with some of the empirical evidence on FDI (see Caves, 1996 , for a discussion of the effects of FDI on market structure and indigenous firms profitability). Therefore, our analysis points to the need for empirical research to disentangle the relative importance of this and of the other factors which determine the welfare effects of FDI on the receiving country.When the capital investment of the MNE is endogenous, the wage setting regime affects the amount of capital invested and the potential for rent extraction. We show that the MNE will tend to underinvest relative to the cost-minimising level in order to limit the rent extraction of the union, if the negotiated wage is positively related to capital investment.We also show that, contrary to what frequently argued, in the absence of taxes/subsidies, the MNE will be less likely to locate in the host country under a decentralised than under a centralised wage setting regime, despite the fact that the latter will typically yield higher wages.Many natural extensions suggest themselves, such as technological spill-overs fromMNEs to domestic firms, experimenting with different degrees of bargaining power of the unions, and examining cases in which the MNE can negotiate special union arrangements", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1348, "end": 1359, "text": "Caves, 1996", "latex": null, "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [], "eq_spans": [], "section": null}], "ref_entries": {"FIGREF0": {"text": "7 where consumer surplus (CS) is zero when firms only export and is positive when firms sell to home consumers.

Thus, the centralised wage is always lower than the decentralised wage paid by the multinational, because even in the absence of product market interaction, centralisation generates a labour market link between the MNE and the domestic firms. Taking this link into account, the unions choose to limit rent extraction from the MNE, in order to maintain employment in the less efficient domestic sector.
