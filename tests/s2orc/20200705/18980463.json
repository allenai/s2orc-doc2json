We show here that the larval eye is composed of 12 PRs, four of which express blue-sensitive rhodopsin5 (rh5) while the other eight contain green-sensitive rh6. This is similar to the 30:70 ratio of adult blue and green R8 cells. However, the stochastic choice of adult color PRs and the bistable loop of the warts and melted tumor suppressor genes that unambiguously specify rh5 and rh6 in R8 PRs are not involved in specification of larval PRs. Instead, primary PR precursors signal via EGFR to surrounding tissue to develop as secondary precursors, which will become Rh6-expressing PRs. EGFR signaling is required for the survival of the Rh6 subtype. Primary precursors give rise to the Rh5 subtype. Furthermore, the combinatorial action of the transcription factors Spalt, Seven-up, and Orthodenticle specifies the two PR subtypes. Therefore, even though the larval PRs and adult R8 PRs express the same rhodopsins (rh5 and rh6), they use very distinct mechanisms for their specification.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": []}, {"section": "Abstract", "text": "[Keywords: Drosophila; visual system development; photoreceptor specification; transcription factor interaction; EGFR signaling] Supplemental material is available at http://www.genesdev.org.

We thus analyzed the expression of Rh5 and Rh6 in sal mutants at the end of embryogenesis, when these mutants die. No expression of Rh5 can be detected in sal mutants, even though the correct Cold (Fig. 6C) .

In the larval eye, svp is exclusively expressed in Rh6 PRs prior to rh6 expression, suggesting that it might be involved in the development of this subtype. We analyzed the expression of Rh5 and Rh6 in svp mutant embryos at stage 17 (as for sal, svp mutants die at the end of embryogenesis). While the total number of PRs (as marked by Elav, FasII, Kr, and Chp) remains unchanged (Fig. 6B,E) in svp mutants, all PRs express Rh5 (Fig. 6B ) and no Rh6 expression is detectable. Therefore, Rh6 cells appear to have switched fate toward the Rh5 fate. Consistent with the transformation of PRs into Rh5 subtype, all PRs express sal in svp mutants (Fig. 6E ). This suggests that svp is necessary for the repression of sal in the Rh6 subtype, thus allowing expression of rh6. To test whether svp is sufficient for the Rh6 PR fate, we performed gain-offunction experiments using early (so-Gal4) or later sevenless-Gal4 (sev-Gal4) drivers. The sev-Gal4 driver starts to be expressed in all larval PRs during late embryonic stages 12/13, just after all immature PRs have formed. It remains expressed through larval life ( Supplementary  Fig. 1B,D; data not shown). In larvae that express UASsvp under the control of so-Gal4, no Rh5 expression can be detected, while all BO PRs express rh6 with no change in the overall number of PRs (Fig. 6F) . However, if sal expression is affected, it is not completely abolished, with one to three PRs still weakly expressing Sal (data not shown), arguing that Rh6 is now expressed in the Rh5 subtype. Later expression of UAS-svp under the control of sev-Gal4 does not result in alteration of Rh expression (data not shown). Thus, svp not only acts to repress sal in the Rh6 subtype, but it also acts as an activator of Rh6 expression since Sal and Rh6 can coexist in the same cell. In contrast ectopic expression of UASsalm under the control of so-Gal4 or of sev-Gal4 leads to no change of Rh5 or Rh6 expression. Expression of Svp remains unaffected, with about eight cells still expressing Svp (data not shown). Thus svp is necessary and sufficient to induce the Rh6 fate.

In the adult retina, otd is expressed in all PRs. Similarly, otd is expressed in all embryonic immature PRs, and this expression is maintained during larval life. During early development, otd acts as a major component for patterning the anterior region of the embryo (Cohen and Jurgens 1990) . During stages 8/9, otd expression spans the entire cephalic region (Fig. 7A) and becomes subsequently restricted to more anterior regions and regions giving rise to the brain. However otd expression is excluded from large parts of the optic lobe primordium as well as from the region giving rise to larval PRs (Fig. 7B) . Starting at stage 12, however, otd expression is reinitiated in the ventral lateral part of the optic lobe primordium, the region that will give rise to the precursors of larval PRs. otd remains expressed in all PRs throughout embryogenesis and larval life (Fig. 7C-F) . otd is not required for the formation of larval PRs (nor the larval optic lobe primordium): Even though otd-null mutant embryos show severe head involution defects, the normal number of immature PRs is formed (data not shown).

The Ets transcription factors yan and pnt are both expressed during the period of secondary precursor specification. In response to EGFR signaling, Yan acts as a repressor and Pnt as an activator. Their tightly controlled activation, cross-regulation, and competition for binding sites are essential for appropriate EGFR signaling. It is difficult, however, to test their function in BO PR formation, as mutants die with strong patterning defects in the embryo. We could test the function of EGFR because we were able to inhibit its function late, specifically in the optic lobe region, by misexpressing a dominant-negative form of EGFR. This likely inhibits but might not completely abolish endogenous EGFR signaling. Thus, even though concomitantly preventing cell death and EGFR signaling restores Rh6 PRs, it is possible that basal levels of EGFR signaling are sufficient for the specification of Rh6 PR specification, but not for survival. The mechanism by which tll affects secondary precursor development remains elusive. tll might prevent cells from developing as secondary precursors, leading them to undergo apoptosis. Only cells that receive enough EGFR signal near primary PR precursors are rescued. Alternatively a second signal could make tll-expressing cells undergo apoptosis. Notch and hedgehog signaling have also been shown to be involved the development of larval PRs and may provide an alternative source for proper subtype specification and tll acts in the surrounding tissue to inhibit secondary precursor development. Primary precursors give rise to the Rh5 PR subtype, whereas secondary precursors give rise to the Rh6 PR subtype.
