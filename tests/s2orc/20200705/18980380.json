This setup can effectively model distributions with a single mode (such as a Gaussian distribution), but less so when modeling multi-mode distributions such as a mixture Gaussian distribution. Moreover, other probabilistic information such as mean, variance etc. cannot be incorporated. Thus, in this technical note, we extend the distributionally robust MDP approach to handle ambiguity sets with more general structures. In particular, we consider a class of ambiguity sets, first proposed in [18] as a unifying framework for modeling and solving distributionally robust single-stage optimization problems, and embed them into the distributionally robust MDPs setup. These ambiguity sets are considerably more general: they are characterized by a class of O i s which can either be nested or disjoint [as shown in Fig. 1(b) ], and moreover, additional linear constraints are allowed to define the ambiguity set, which can be used to incorporate probabilistic information such as mean, covariance or other variation measures.

The detailed implementation is as follows: For the robust and two distributionally robust strategies, we construct uncertainty set corresponding to 99% probability support of the rewards for the first 49 states, and 99.9% for the 50th state that is more risky, using estimated mean and variance (see [22] for details). For the first distributionally robust strategy proposed in [1] , we construct two additional nested confidence sets O 1 50 and O 2 50 [see Fig. 4(a) ], which w.p. 40%-50% and 60%-70% respectively the uncertain rewards belong to. In contrast, for the second distributionally robust strategy proposed in this technical note, we construct two disjoint confidence sets O 1 50 and O 2 50 [see Fig. 4 (b)] with 70%-80% and 0%-10% confidence level, respectively. Specifically, we select these two intervals around the peaks of the two Gaussian elements [i.e., N (100, 10) and N (140, 2)] to better model this mixed distribution.
