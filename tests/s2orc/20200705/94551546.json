The Ad-PGMA species were further functionalized with excess EA to produce the corresponding Ad-PGEA1 and Ad-PGEA2 guests with different molecular weights. Similar to our previous studies, 15, 16 Ad-PGMA and Ad-PGEA were successfully prepared, as shown by the NMR results (Supplementary Figure S3 ).

The gel retardation results of polymer/pDNA complexes with increasing N/P ratios are shown in Figure 1 . All PGED@PGEA and PGED-Gd@PGEA could compact pDNA completely within the N/P ratio of 1.5, whereas the PGED-CD-Gd backbone and Ad-PGEA guests only condensed pDNA when N/P ratios reached 2.5. The above results indicated that the pDNAcondensing ability of PGED@PGEA and PGED-Gd@PGEA is better than that of PGED-CD-Gd and Ad-PGEA, which is probably because of the high molecular weight supramolecular structures. 35 The particle size and the \u03b6-potential of polymer/pDNA complexes with increasing N/P ratio are shown in Figure 2 . The particle sizes of all complexes decreased with increasing N/P ratios. At lower N/P ratios, loose aggregates with large size were formed owing to the few positive charges on the polymers. 36 With an increase in the N/P ratios, the diameters of all complexes decreased to 100-150 nm, which enabled the complexes to easily undergo endocytosis. It was also noted that at both low and high N/P ratios, the polycation/pDNA complexes had good stability (Supplementary Figure S4 ). In addition to particle sizes, the \u03b6-potential of polymer/pDNA complexes are another factor that affects cellular uptake. All of the complexes had positive \u03b6-potentials, and the values of the \u03b6-potential slightly increased with the N/P ratios. Owing to the positive charges, polymer/pDNA complexes had a good affinity for the negatively charged cell membrane and were able to facilitate cellular uptake. 37 The \u03b6-potential values of PGED@PGEA and PGED-Gd@PGEA groups were higher than those of the PGED-CD-Gd backbone and Ad-PGEA guests, once again confirming that PGMA-based supramolecular polycations possessed better DNA-compacting ability.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 933, "end": 935, "text": "35", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1241, "end": 1243, "text": "36", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1932, "end": 1934, "text": "37", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 513, "end": 521, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 1039, "end": 1047, "text": "Figure 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 1515, "end": 1524, "text": "Figure S4", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}]}, {"section": "RESULTS AND DISCUSSION", "text": "The morphology of polymer/pDNA complexes was observed by AFM.
